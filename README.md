## Welcome to our project  

## How to run our site

For this tutorial on how to set up and run our project we recommend using Visual Studio Code with its integrated terminal.

##### One of the easiest ways to do this, is to do as follows:

First copy the repository HTTPS address.

![HTTPS Address](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/854123718753779762/1035045722296438864/unknown.png)

Then we should position ourselves in the directory we want our folder to be downloaded

Next, clone our repository using git clone + the HTTPS address.
Type in the Git terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/MelinaLencina/TPO-CaC-Python.git 
```

A folder will be created, access it by typing the following line in the terminal:

```
cd TPO-CaC-Python
```


Then you'll be able to open our project from your VSC or your browser, it should start running smoothly without any issues.

### Happy hacking!

The science behind our site!
----------------------------

We are a team of three members. We used SCRUM for the development of this project. 

![Agile methodology](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/854123718753779762/1035043486413627452/unknown.png?width=484&height=468) 

There was constant feedback among the team; we shared our code and help each other when there were bugs and issues


# Project structure

#### Navbar and footer:

Using the navbar, you can go to Home, Form, Our recipes, and Submit your recipe. 

Our footer shows you who developed the project, and uses `<a>` tags that allow you to connect with the team through LinkedIn.


#### Home page:

We designed a landing page for the user to navigate the site. 
On this page, you can read about the site's goal, features, and even reviews!

#### Form page:

Our form allows you to send us a recipe of your own (it's a mockup, non-functional). You'll write its title, ingredients, description, and you can add an image for it (URL).
